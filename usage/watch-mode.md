# Watch mode

Watch mode runs tests in process without exiting from it. It watches for the new test files or changes in the existing tests and reruns tests immediately.

## Options

Watch mode has some key bindings:

**R -** runs last launched tests

**A** - runs all the tests&#x20;

**P -** pauses watch mode, so it will not run tests again until unpaused

**T -** toogles watch mode caching. About test caching [here](configuration.md#config-options)

**C -** clears console

**H -** toggles help with key bindings

**Q -** exit from watch mode
